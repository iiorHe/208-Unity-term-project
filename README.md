# 208-Unity-term-project
This is a Unity project I whipped up in 2 weeks time for my term paper for Object-Oriented programming.
I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CONTENT USED.
2D sprites were taken from Doom 2, community mods, and from the ZDoom community forums. Level Textures were taken from Quake 1, and makkon texture packs made by Ben Hale over at https://twitter.com/makkon_art. Sounds were taken from Doom 2, Quake 1, Half-Life, Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat, which are owned by Sound Ideas.
