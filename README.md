# 208-Unity-term-project
This is a Unity term project for my second year of Univeristy. It's a basic FPS demo, made with a Retro aesthetic in mind.
I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CONTENT IN THE GAME. With the exception of the Player sounds which were record by me. This project was created for Educational-purposes.
